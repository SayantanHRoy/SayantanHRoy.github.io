I am currently a fourth year Economics PhD student at Purdue University. My research focuses on how social insurance programs, such as Unemployment Insurance (U.I.), help mitigate economic shocks, with an emphasis on labor and firm heterogeneity.

I have a BSc  in Economics, with minors in Mathematics and Statistics, from Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, University of Calcutta, and a M.A in Economics from the Madras School of Economics

After completing my masterâ€™s degree, I joined American Express as a Decision Scientist in the commercial decision science team. In this role, I developed XGBoost models for credit risk assessment, focusing on predicting transaction-level credit risks and evaluating the impact of these models on different population segments.

Currently, my research explores how predictable seasonal shocks, such as school closures, affect labor supply and how social insurance systems, particularly U.I., can mitigate these shocks. My research involves using nationally representative datasets, such as the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), to construct granular patterns of U.I. usage and assess the role of social insurance in smoothing economic shocks for households. Additionally, I am researching whether large-scale transfer payments executed in the aftermath of the Great Recession alleviated local labor market scarring, which ties into my broader interests in understanding the macroeconomic impact of social insurance.
