## From Recession to Recovery: The Role of Fiscal Policy on Labor Market Recovery
*Ongoing*

In the wake of the 2008 Great Recession, the Obama administration passed the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to assist those most affected by the economic downturn. It 
included measures such as increased general transfers (e.g., SNAP), unemployment insurance 
(UI) extensions, and grant-in-aid transfers to help patch budgetary shortfalls. Of the 
<span>$</span>&nbsp;234 billion was spent on discretionary grant-in-aid transfers, which 
lacked a well-defined benefit formula compared to UI. 

Using county-level variation in ARRA spending from 2009-2012, I find that a 1% increase in per
capita government spending raised the cumulative employment-population ratio by 0.04 percentage 
points over 2007-2015. Importantly, I uncover significant geographic heterogeneity: 
medium-sized counties (population 100,000) showed strong responses, while both very large
(1 million) and small counties (10,000) displayed minimal effects.

## Gender Gaps in Employment Seasonality: The Role of Unemployment Insurance
*Ongoing*

Labor market risk naturally arises due to seasonal shocks. For example, construction 
employment peaks in summer and slows in December, while retail surges in December and dips 
in January. A key question is whether this seasonality also appears in the number of workers 
receiving Unemployment Insurance (U.I.) benefits each month. 

While U.I. is designed to protect against unexpected shocks, seasonal fluctuations in insured 
unemployment may still occur as firms lay off excess workers during off-peak periods. The 
imperfect experience-rated tax structure of U.I. incentivizes firms to retain surplus 
workers, with layoffs following these seasonal cycles. I document significant seasonal 
differences in insured unemployment between men and women. Gendered patterns in employment 
and caregiving responsibilities likely contribute to the distinct seasonality observed for 
women.
