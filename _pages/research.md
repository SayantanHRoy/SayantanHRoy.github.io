## From Recession to Recovery: The Role of Fiscal Policy on Labor Market Recovery
*Ongoing*

In the wake of the 2008 Great Recession, the Obama administration passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to assist those most affected by the economic downturn. It included measures such as increased general transfers (e.g., SNAP), unemployment insurance (UI) extensions, and grant-in-aid transfers to help patch budgetary shortfalls. Of the <span>$</span>&nbsp;800 billion allocated, <span>$</span>&nbsp;234 billion was spent on discretionary grant-in-aid transfers, which lacked a well-defined benefit formula compared to UI. Using complete market models as a benchmark, I evaluate whether this <span>$</span>&nbsp;234 billion expenditure was effective in stabilizing the economy and addressing disparities across impacted regions.

## Gender Gaps in Employment Seasonality: The Role of Unemployment Insurance
*Ongoing*

Labor market risk naturally arises due to seasonal shocks. For example, construction employment peaks in summer and slows in December, while retail surges in December and dips in January. A key question is whether this seasonality also appears in the number of workers receiving Unemployment Insurance (U.I.) benefits each month. While U.I. is designed to protect against unexpected shocks, seasonal fluctuations in insured unemployment may still occur as firms lay off excess workers during off-peak periods. The imperfect experience-rated tax structure of U.I. incentivizes firms to retain surplus workers, with layoffs following these seasonal cycles. I document significant seasonal differences in insured unemployment between men and women. Gendered patterns in employment and caregiving responsibilities likely contribute to the distinct seasonality observed for women.
